# watertap-ui

This repository is for work on the user interface(s) (UI) for the WaterTAP library.

## Getting started (developer)

### Prerequisites

The following steps assume that:

1. `conda` is already installed and configured
2. This repository (i.e. the WaterTAP UI repository, https://github.com/watertap-org/watertap-ui) has been cloned locally and the working directory is set to the root of the repository

### 1. Creating the Conda environment

Run the following command to create and activate a new Conda environment named `watertap-ui-env`:

```sh
conda env create --file environment.yml && conda activate watertap-ui-env
```

This will install the correct runtime versions of both the backend (Python) and frontend (JavaScript/NodeJS/Electron) portions of the UI, as well as the backend (Python) dependencies.

### 2. Install the JavaScript dependencies

Run the following command to install the JavaScript dependencies:

```sh
bash -c "cd electron && npm clean-install"
```

### 3. Install the IDAES solver dependencies

```sh
idaes get-extensions --verbose
```

### 4. (Optional) Install the developer version of WaterTAP

By default, Step 1 above will install the `watertap` Python package from the current `main` branch of the watertap-org/watertap repository.

To use the WaterTAP UI with the development version of WaterTAP, run the following steps:

#### 4.0. (Optional) Clone the `watertap-org/watertap` repository locally

If you already have a local clone of the WaterTAP repository, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, run the following command to create a local clone of the WaterTAP repository in a directory of your choice, e.g. `/path/to/my/watertap`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/watertap-org/ /path/to/my/watertap
```

#### 4.1. Ensure that the `watertap-ui-env` Conda environment is active

```sh
conda activate watertap-ui-env
```

#### 4.2. Uninstall the currently installed version of WaterTAP

```sh
pip uninstall --yes watertap
```

#### 4.3. Install the development version of WaterTAP

The following assumes that the `watertap-org/watertap` repository has been cloned to a directory named `/path/to/my/watertap`.

```sh
bash -c "cd /path/to/my/watertap && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt"
```

### Run UI

```console
cd <watertap-ui-path>/electron
npm start
```

## Windows instructions

The JS spawning doesn't work on Windows, so in order to start the app there you need to start things by hand using the following commands:

0. Turn off default browser opening with `$Env:Browser="none"`
1. From the repo root: `cd backend/app` and run `uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload &`
2. Next `cd ../../electron/ui` and run `npm start &`. 
3. Finally: `cd ..` (now in 'electron' subdir) and run `npm start`
